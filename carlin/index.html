    <h2> The Dean of Counterculture Comedians</h2>
    <p>Carlin was a large proponent of freedom of speech, actively criticizing the government and it's citizens for their ineptitude and apathy.
    He cause a ruckus with "Seven words you can never say on Television" when he rapidly fired off shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, and tits in his monologue back in '72 leaving watchdog groups scrambling to counter.
    As an atheist he likened god to Joe Pesci in that he could have prayed to either and had the same success rate for answered prayers.</p>
    <p>Taking a page from Lenny Bruce, Carlin was irreverent and logical, he wouldn't walk on eggshells or censor himself.
    His stating things as they were and no bullshit approach to comedy combined with his genius allowed him to paint a picture of how screwed up the world was but still make people laugh.
    If not for Carlin's insights the world would be a far more ignorant and pointlessly politically correct place.</p>
